## State Population 
I used the data provided by [AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects) to create SQL queries to analyze the total deaths of COVID 19 by year and by state. I used [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=102723042158:ff0668dfa4864282a328d7024192beef) as my platform to run these queries. 
# Visuals
I then used [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jerchiel.jusi/viz/StatePopulationCOVID-19/StatePopulationHistory) to create visuals regarding my report.
